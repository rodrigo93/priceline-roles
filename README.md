# Roles

This service is responsible for managing the roles of the users.

It enhances the `Users` and `Teams` services, by giving us the concept of team
roles and  the ability to associate them with team members.

> Note: This service doesn't hold any **Team** or **User** table as they are
> managed by their respective services.

## Stack

- Ruby on Rails 7.0 (API mode)
- PostgreSQL 13
- Rspec
- Docker + Composer

## Setup

> **Before proceding, make sure that you have `docker` and `docker-compose`
installed. See https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ for more information.**

All you need to do is build the images and run the containers.

Build images:
```shell
docker compose build
```

### Database

> If this is the first time running the app, run all following commands.

#### Create the database
```shell
docker compose run --rm api bin/rails db:create
```

#### Running migrations
```shell
docker compose run --rm api bin/rails db:migrate
docker compose run --rm api bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

#### Adding data
```shell
docker compose run --rm api bin/rails db:seed
```

## Running the app

```shell
docker compose up
```

## Testing

Testing the application is pretty simple, it uses Rspec and you can run the
tests with docker:

```shell
docker compose run --rm api bundle exec rspec
```

Or, if you have everything set locally:

```shell
bundle exec rspec
```

## Accessing the app

- Rails API: http://localhost:3000

## Documentation

The documentation is generated by Swagger and it's available at
http://localhost:3000/api-docs/index.html.

### Updating documentation

```shell
rake rswag:specs:swaggerize
```

### Starting new documentation

You can generate a initial documentation for an existing controller like this:
```shell
rails generate rspec:swagger <controller_name>
```

for instance

```shell
rails generate rspec:swagger Api::MembershipsController
```
